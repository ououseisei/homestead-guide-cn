Web 3.0：一个去中心化应用的平台
********************************************************************************


Web 3.0，指的是一个像DNS、数字身份标识之类的核心互联网服务已经去中心化的、使人们可以通过与他人进行经济上的交往而紧密的结合起来的，新一代的互联网。而越来越多的事实使我们相信，像以太坊这样开放的、去信任的区块链平台，已经可以完美的适合作为去中心化的安全互联网，Web 3.0，的共享“后端”支撑平台了。

就像以太坊的开发者设想的那样，以太坊是一个空白的画布，可以使你用它创造任何你想要的东西。以太坊协议是抽象设计的，以便使核心特性可以随意的进行组合。 理论上讲，以太坊上的去中心化应用（dapp）项目，将借助以太坊区块链去创造那些先前不可能实现的、基于去中心化共识的新产品或服务。

也许对以太坊最合适的描述是将其视为一个生态系统：由各种各样的基础设施、代码和社区所共同支持的核心协议构成了以太坊项目。以太坊也可以被理解为使用它的那些项目的集合。 现在，像Augur、Digix、Maker和其他很多（参考 :ref:`dapps`）备受瞩目的项目已经在以太坊上构建了起来。另外还有很多开发团队也已经创建了很多开源组件供人们使用。尽管这些组织是独立于以太坊基金会之外的、都有他们自己的目标，但他们毫无疑问的都已经从以太坊的生态系统中获益了。

Smart contracts
================================================================================

by Alex:

Would you enter in a contract with someone you've never met? Would you agree to lend money to some farmer in Ethiopia? Would you become an investor in a minority-run newspaper in a war zone? Would you go to the hassle of writing up a legal binding contract for a $5 dollar purchase over the internet?

The answer is no for most of these questions, the reason being that a contract requires a large infrastructure: sometimes you need a working trust relationship between the two parties, sometimes you rely on a working legal system, police force and lawyer costs.

In Ethereum you don't need any of that: if all the requisites to the contract can be put in the blockchain then they will, in a trustless environment for almost no cost.

Instead of thinking of moving your current contracts to the blockchain, think of all the thousand little contracts that you would never agree to simply because they weren't economically feasible or there was not enough legal protection..


DAO
================================================================================

Here is just one example: imagine you own a small business with your friends. Lawyers and accountants are expensive, and trusting a single partner to oversee the books can be a source of tension (even an opportunity for fraud). Complying strictly with a system in which more than one partner oversees the books can be trying and is subject to fraud whenever the protocol isn't followed exactly.

Using a smart contract, ownership in your company and terms for the disbursal of funds can be specified at the outset. The smart contract can be written such that it is only changeable given the approval of a majority of owners. Smart contracts like these will likely be available as open source software, so you won't even need to hire your own programmer instead of an accountant/lawyer.

A smart contract like this scales instantly. A couple of teenagers can split revenue from a lemonade stand just as transparently as a sovereign wealth fund can disburse funds to the hundred million citizens who are entitled to it. In both cases the price of this transparency is likely to be fractions of a penny per dollar.
