   for now).

0.2.1 (2016-01-30)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Inline arrays, i.e. ``var y = [1,x,f()];`` if there is a common type
   for ``1``, ``x`` and ``f()``. Note that the result is always a
   fixed-length memory array and conversion to dynamic-length memory
   arrays is not yet possible.
-  Import similar to ECMAScript6 import (``import "abc.sol" as d`` and
   ``import {x, y} from "abc.sol"``).
-  Commandline compiler solc automatically resolves missing imports and
   allows for "include directories".
-  Conditional: ``x ? y : z``
-  Bugfix: Fixed several bugs where the optimizer generated invalid
   code.
-  Bugfix: Enums and structs were not accessible to other contracts.
-  Bugfix: Fixed segfault connected to function paramater types,
   appeared during gas estimation.
-  Bugfix: Type checker crash for wrong number of base constructor
   parameters.
-  Bugfix: Allow function overloads with different array types.
-  Bugfix: Allow assignments of type ``(x) = 7``.
-  Bugfix: Type ``uint176`` was not available.
-  Bugfix: Fixed crash during type checking concerning constructor
   calls.
-  Bugfix: Fixed crash during code generation concerning invalid
   accessors for struct types.
-  Bugfix: Fixed crash during code generating concerning computing a
   hash of a struct type.

0.2.0 (2015-12-02)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Breaking Change**: ``new ContractName.value(10)()`` has to be
   written as ``(new ContractName).value(10)()``
-  Added ``selfdestruct`` as an alias for ``suicide``.
-  Allocation of memory arrays using ``new``.
-  Binding library functions to types via ``using x for y``
-  ``addmod`` and ``mulmod`` (modular addition and modular
   multiplication with arbitrary intermediate precision)
-  Bugfix: Constructor arguments of fixed array type were not read
   correctly.
-  Bugfix: Memory allocation of structs containing arrays or strings.
-  Bugfix: Data location for explicit memory parameters in libraries was
   set to storage.

0.1.7 (2015-11-17)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Improved error messages for unexpected tokens.

   contracts.

-  Bugfix: Writing to elements of ``bytes`` or ``string`` overwrite
   others.
-  Bugfix: "Successor block not found" on Windows.
-  Bugfix: Using string literals in tuples.
-  Bugfix: Cope with invalid commit hash in version for libraries.
-  Bugfix: Some test framework fixes on windows.

0.1.6 (2015-10-16)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``.push()`` for dynamic storage arrays.
-  Tuple expressions (``(1,2,3)`` or ``return (1,2,3);``)
-  Declaration and assignment of multiple variables
   (``var (x,y,) = (1,2,3,4,5);`` or ``var (x,y) = f();``)
-  Destructuring assignment (``(x,y,) = (1,2,3)``)
-  Bugfix: Internal error about usage of library function with invalid
   types.
-  Bugfix: Correctly parse ``Library.structType a`` at statement level.
-  Bugfix: Correctly report source locations of parenthesized
   expressions (as part of "tuple" story).

0.1.5 (2015-10-07)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Breaking change in storage encoding: Encode short byte arrays and
   strings together with their length in storage.
-  Report warnings
-  Allow storage reference types for public library functions.
-  Access to types declared in other contracts and libraries via ``.``.
-  Version stamp at beginning of runtime bytecode of libraries.
-  Bugfix: Problem with initialized string state variables and dynamic
   data in constructor.
-  Bugfix: Resolve dependencies concerning ``new`` automatically.
-  Bugfix: Allow four indexed arguments for anonymous events.
-  Bugfix: Detect too large integer constants in functions that accept
   arbitrary parameters.

0.1.4 (2015-09-30)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Bugfix: Returning fixed-size arrays.

-  Linker stage for compiler to insert other contract's addresses (used
   for libraries).
-  Compiler option to output runtime part of contracts.
-  Compile-time out of bounds check for access to fixed-size arrays by
   integer constants.
-  Version string includes libevmasm/libethereum's version (contains the
   optimizer).
-  Bugfix: Accessors for constant public state variables.
-  Bugfix: Propagate exceptions in clone contracts.
-  Bugfix: Empty single-line comments are now treated properly.
-  Bugfix: Properly check the number of indexed arguments for events.
-  Bugfix: Strings in struct constructors.

0.1.2 (2015-08-20)
